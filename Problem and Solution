# One-Pager: National AI Transparency and Accountability Act of 2025

Problem: Americans are increasingly denied jobs, loans, housing, and benefits by secret AI systems with no explanation or appeal.

2. Tell people when AI made the decision (notice + link)
3. Biggest systems get an independent audit every 2 years

Constitutionally safe ✓ | Innovation-friendly ✓ | Bipartisan ✓  
Ready for immediate introduction in House or Senate
