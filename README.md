“Citizen-drafted federal bill requiring model cards, impact assessments, and independent audits for high-impact AI systems”  
# National AI Transparency and Accountability Act of 2025

**Ready-to-introduce federal legislation**  
Co-drafted live with Grok (xAI) on November 20, 2025

A short, bipartisan, constitutionally-sound bill that requires:
- Public model cards & impact assessments  
- Clear notice when AI makes consequential decisions  
- Independent audits for the biggest systems  

No bans. No overreach. Just basic transparency so Americans know when AI is deciding their loan, job, or healthcare.
